# Green House App

## Description

Green House App is a (Tea House Shop) web application for demo purposes using HTML5 APIs and built for handheld devices. The App is based on [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Sammy](http://code.quirkey.com/sammy) JavaScript frameworks.

## Get the code

Download the source code from GitHub:

    git clone git://github.com/yaanno/greenhouseapp.git

To get the depencencies (jQuery, Sammy):

    cd greenhouseapp
    
    git submodule init
    
    git submodule update

Although it is optional to use jQuery as a submodule, it is always nice to see what is happening on the edge :)

To build your own jQuery distribution:
    
    cd assets/js/lib/jquery
    
    make

## Notice

The app is very initial at this stage so don't expect too much :)
